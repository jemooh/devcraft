    							<h6>About event</h6>
    							<p>DevCraft is a conference for software developers by software developers. Its aim is to raise the quality of the software craft in Kenya through providing access to a community that champions good software development practices. In this global economy, it is becoming more important for developers to match their standards with international best practices. </p>
    							<p>Though the focus is on improving the quality of software development, our conference is not limited to software developers. Our goal is not just to improve the quality of the individual developers but also to improve the culture of software development in companies and organisations. Our event is open to anyone involved in the software development process i.e. UI/UX designers, Quality Assurance Experts, Project Managers, Product Managers, Business Development Experts and of-course, Software engineers.</p>

    							<h6>Workshops</h6>
    							<p>DevCraft was born out of the <a href="http://ihub.co.ke/training/craftmanship-training">Craftsmanship Series</a>, a series of developer-centric trainings that are aimed towards raising the quality of the software craft in Kenya.  After a successful round of trainings we decided to have a conference dedicated specifically to this topic. DevCraft will cater to developers of all skill levels and all languages covering major tracks like software development, professional practices, Dev-Ops, Scrum, APIs, software design, soft skills and emotional intelligence among others.</p>
